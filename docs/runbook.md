# Coconut Wireless Runbook

## Incident Response Basics

1. Confirm scope:
   - Is outage global or partial?
   - Is `/healthz/` failing?
2. Check latest deploy and CI status.
3. Review platform logs for startup/configuration/database errors.
4. Run smoke checks:
   - `/`
   - `/healthz/`
   - `/admin/login/`
5. If `SENTRY_DSN` is configured, inspect Sentry for top exceptions and release markers.

## First-Line Mitigations

- Restart app instance.
- Verify required env vars are set correctly (`DJANGO_ENV`, `DEBUG`, `SECRET_KEY`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `DATABASE_URL`).
- Verify database availability and credentials.
- Verify object storage settings are valid (`OBJECT_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`, bucket, keys, endpoint if applicable).
- Verify SMTP settings are valid (`EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`).

## Rollback

1. Select the previous known-good deploy in the hosting platform.
2. Redeploy that version.
3. Re-run smoke checks and `python manage.py check --deploy`.
4. Communicate status update and record timeline.

## Escalation

- Escalate persistent data-layer failures immediately.
- Escalate repeated 5xx responses after rollback.
- Open a follow-up issue with:
  - trigger time
  - impact
  - root cause (if known)
  - remediation and prevention actions

## Tradie Verification Operations

Use Django Admin → **Tradie Profiles** for verification decisions:

- `pending`: default state after provider signup; provider cannot quote or request appointments
- `approved`: documents accepted; provider can quote and book appointments
- `rejected`: provider blocked pending remediation
- `suspended`: provider blocked after approval due to risk/compliance concerns

Recommended verification cadence:

- Closed beta: review pending submissions at least once per business day
- High onboarding periods: review twice daily

Minimum review checklist for each provider:

1. TIN letter uploaded and legible
2. If Electrical selected, electrical licence uploaded
3. If Plumbing selected, plumber licence uploaded
4. Business details and service towns look valid
5. Verification notes updated in admin when rejecting/suspending
